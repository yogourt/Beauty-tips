# CosmetiqueOrganique

This is an Android app developed by me during Udacidy Nanodegree Program for Android Developers. 
It's purpose is to serve users recipes for homemade cosmetics. Everyone can make them at home
and you lifestyle will be a lot healthier! 

In this app I've used Material Design principles. It contains custom animations and transitions. 
The app's database is Firebase Database. It uses many Firebase features, like Authentication, Push
Notifications, Analytics.
